# React

## Hooks
- Follow the Rules of Hooks
- Keep hooks focused and simple
- Avoid nested hooks
- Custom hooks are only for hooking in to React lifecycle, otherwise make a regular function
- Use appropriate dependency arrays in useEffect
- Implement cleanup in useEffect when needed

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Implement useReducer for complex state logic
- Components with too many pieces of state should be broken down
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Avoid excessive prop drilling
- Use state management libraries only when necessary

## Performance
- Implement proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper key props in lists
- Profile and optimize render performance

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Handle focus management
- Provide proper alt text for images

## Naming Convetions
- Suffix interfaces for React props with 'Props' (e.g., ButtonProps)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
