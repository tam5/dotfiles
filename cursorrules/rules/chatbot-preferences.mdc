# Chat guidelines

## Verify Information

Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## Chatting with the User
- Never use apologies
- Don't summarize changes made
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation

## Changes
- Don't invent changes unrelated to what's explicitly requested
- Don't suggest whitespace changes
- Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## Commands
- Don't run dev servers unless you are using them yourself to test

## Installing Dependencies
- Do not install new packages or libraries without asking me first
- Explain the justification for the new package
- Present alternatives considered
- Show the version you will install as well as the latest available version

## Stay up to date
- Stay up to date with the latest changes to the codebase
- Whenever interacting with third party packages or dependencies, make sure you have updated your knowledge to reflect the version being used in the codeabse
